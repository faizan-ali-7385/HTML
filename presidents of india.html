      <h1><b>1.Dr. Rajendra prasad</b></h1>
      <p>Rajendra Prasad, (born December 3, 1884, Zeradei, India—died February 28, 1963, Patna), Indian politician, lawyer, and journalist who was the first president of the Republic of India (1950–62). He also was a comrade of Mahatma Gandhi early in the noncooperation movement for independence and was president of the Indian National Congress (1934, 1939, and 1947).</p>
      <p>Raised in a landowning family of modest means, Prasad was a graduate of the Calcutta Law College. He practiced at the Calcutta High Court and in 1916 transferred to the Patna High Court and founded the Bihar Law Weekly. In 1917 he was recruited by Gandhi to help in a campaign to improve conditions for peasants exploited by British indigo planters in Bihar. He gave up his law practice in 1920 to join the noncooperation movement. Becoming an active journalist in the nationalist interest, he wrote for Searchlight in English, founded and edited the Hindi weekly Desh (“Country”), and started his lifelong campaign to establish Hindi as the national language. Imprisoned several times by the British for noncooperation activities, he served nearly three years (August 1942–June 1945) in jail with the Congress Party’s Working Committee.</p>
